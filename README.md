# ducky
Experimenting with DuckDB-Wasm - uses https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm/tree/master/packages/duckdb-wasm-app as a starting point for the app

Testing out some new (to me) things:
- DuckDB
- Nivo for visualizations
- ChakraUI to see how it compares to MUI
- GitHub Actions

Check out the [live app](https://danperkins.github.io/ducky/)!

Below is a preview of the current functionality:
- Create a new table by using a local Parquet file
- Issue queries and view results via table
- Use ScatterPlot to visualize results
